# learningJava

This is my personal Java learning journey based on Bro Code's YouTube tutorials.

## Structure

The project is organized into daily folders like `DAY1_71625`, each containing Java files I practiced that day.  
Each folder reflects a day's worth of focused learning, with filenames representing specific concepts covered.

## Goals

- Relearn and reinforce core Java concepts
- Practice writing clean, working code daily (ðŸ¤ž)
- Build a solid foundation so I donâ€™t have to rely too much on external resources too often
- Refine my backend development skills and strengthen my Spring Boot projects
