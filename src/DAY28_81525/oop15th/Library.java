/*
 * Library.java
 * 
 * Represents a Library object that can contain multiple Book objects.
 * 
 * Demonstrates Aggregation:
 * - The Library class has a "HAS-A" relationship with the Book class.
 * - A Library can contain many Books, but those Books are not dependent on the Library.
 * - Both Library and Book are independent classes that can exist on their own.
