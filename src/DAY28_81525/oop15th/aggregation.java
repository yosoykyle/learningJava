/*
 * aggregation.java
 * 
 * This program demonstrates the concept of Aggregation in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
 * 
 * Key Idea of Aggregation:
 * - Aggregation represents a "HAS-A" relationship between classes.
 * - One object contains references to another object as part of its structure.
 * - Unlike inheritance, the contained objects (the "parts") are independent and can exist
 *   without the container object.
 * 
 * Example in this program:
 * - A Library "HAS-A" collection of Book objects.
 * - Even if the Library object is destroyed, the Book objects can still exist independently.
 * 
 * Difference from Inheritance:
 * - Inheritance ("IS-A" relationship): a subclass is a specialized form of a superclass. 
 *   Example: Dog IS-A Animal.
 * - Aggregation ("HAS-A" relationship): a class contains another class as a field. 
 *   Example: Car HAS-A Engine.
 * 
 * Usage in software design:
 * - Aggregation is used when modeling real-world entities composed of smaller, independent parts.
 * - Inheritance is used when creating hierarchies where specialized classes share common behavior.
